# ✅ FreightShark Database Migration Complete

## Summary

Successfully migrated FreightShark from localStorage to **Supabase PostgreSQL database**.

## ✅ What Was Accomplished

### 🔧 Backend Infrastructure
- Created complete Supabase service layer (`src/services/supabaseService.ts`)

### 🗄️ Database Setup
- **Tables Created**: users, sessions, quote_requests, quotes, shipments, tracking_events, documents, announcements
- **Demo Users**: 3 users with proper bcrypt password hashing
- **Database Functions**: ID sequence generation, auto-update timestamps
- **Indexes**: Performance optimized for common queries

### 🧪 Testing
- ✅ Database connection verified
- ✅ Demo users accessible
- ✅ Quote request creation tested
- ✅ Data persistence confirmed

### 🔐 Authentication
- Enhanced AuthService with database integration
- Falls back to localStorage only when database unavailable
- Proper password hashing with bcrypt
- JWT token management

## 🚀 Current Status

### App URLs
